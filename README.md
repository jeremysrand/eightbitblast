A simple text mode arcade game for the Apple II where you try to shoot the 8 bit competition.

You are the Apple represented by the @ character at the bottom of the screen.  A series of
Commodore and Atari 8 bit computers are moving down the screen towards you, represented
by C and A characters respectively.

Use the left and right arrows to move the Apple out of the way.  Do not let these lesser
computers crash into your Apple II!  Use the space bar to shoot (represented by an
exclamation mark) to destroy any computers which get in your way.

Atari computers aren't as common as Commodore so they are worth 100 points if you destroy
one.  But destroying a Commodore is only worth 10 points.  You know why.
